# Glossary


## Agent

In Fleet's context, an agent is a Kubernetes deployment responsible for deploying workloads to its cluster.
This entails monitoring a specific namespace on the upstream cluster, and deploying any bundle deployments, living in that namespace, to the downstream cluster where the agent lives.

## Bundle

A bundle is a Fleet-specific resource (also known as a [Custom Resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) in Kubernetes) representing a workload, or set of user resources, to be deployed. It is typically generated by Fleet from a path of a git repository.

## Chart

See [this definition](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/) of a Helm chart.

## Cluster

A cluster refers to:
* a [Kubernetes cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/) managed by Fleet
* a `Cluster` [resource](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/blob/main/pkg/apis/fleet.cattle.io/v1alpha1/cluster_types.go#L59) in Fleet's API, which Fleet uses to manage that Kubernetes cluster
## Continuous Delivery
## Custom Resource

See [this official definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/).
In short, a custom resource is a resource defined for the purposes of an application (in our case Fleet), to extend the set of resources supported by the Kubernetes API (pods, deployments, services, etc).
## Custom Resource Definition

See [this explanation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#customresourcedefinitions) from the Kubernetes docs.
## Deployment

## Downstream Cluster

A downstream cluster is a Kubernetes cluster where user workloads will run, without any Fleet controllers living there. It is a target cluster for Fleet, where only a Fleet agent lives beside user workloads.

## fleet.yaml

A `fleet.yaml` file lives in a git repository and stores options for a bundle and bundle deployments to be generated from that bundle. More information is available [here](https://fleet.rancher.io/ref-fleet-yaml).
## GitOps
## GitRepo

A `GitRepo` is a Fleet-specific resource, to be used as an entry point to using Fleet.
Creating a `GitRepo` pointing to a set of paths in a git repository enables Fleet to monitor those paths and deploy resources stored or referenced there.
## Label

## Multi-Cluster

A multi-cluster setup involves more than one cluster: the upstream cluster, needed to manage deployment of workloads, and at least one downstream cluster.
## Namespace
## Reconcile

Reconciling is used in the context of states in Kubernetes clusters. Reconciling a resource means updating it so that its _actual_ state matches its _expected_ state, be it from configuration, eg. from a git repository, chart, etc.

When using GitOps, updates to a git repository may translate into new expected states for resources configured through that git repository. As a result, affected resources will be reconciled.
A resource's state may also depend on another resource, leading to additional reconciliation. For instance, a cluster group's status depends on statuses of individual clusters contained in that cluster group. Therefore, a change in a cluster's state will result in any cluster group(s) to which that cluster belongs to being reconciled as well.

## Registration

Cluster registration is the process of getting a Fleet agent, living in a downstream cluster, recognised by Fleet controllers in the upstream cluster.
Once registration is complete for a downstream cluster, Fleet is able to deploy workloads to that cluster.
## Repository
## Resources

## Target

Fleet uses this word in the context of determining where a workload will run. This represents a _destination_ cluster for a workload.
## Upstream Cluster

A Kubernetes cluster where Fleet controllers run. This is the cluster where `GitRepo`s, bundles and bundle deployments are created.
Also called _management_ cluster.

## Workload

A workload represents what users want to deploy through Fleet. It may be a set of Helm charts, Kubernetes manifests, kustomize, etc, stored or referenced in a git repository.

When a user creates a `GitRepo` resource pointing to that git repository, and subsequently when relevant changes are found in that repository, Fleet deploys workloads.
